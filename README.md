During my internship, I worked on a project called
SalesManagement, which helps companies manage their sales processes more effectively and
efficiently. This project was designed using MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Clean
Architecture, ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable code structure. We utilized
technologies such as C#, ASP .NET Core, Entity Framework, and MSSQL. Additionally, I gained
practical experience in project management, customer relationship management (CRM), and
software development. Participating in this project enhanced my teamwork and
communication skills and allowed me to actively engage in all stages of the software
development process.
